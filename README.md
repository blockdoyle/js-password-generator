# js-password-generator

A simple password generator written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Overview

This is a simple password generator written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes arrays, math random methods, and window properties. A challenge that I faced while writing this was finding a simpler way of adding the options of letters, numbers, and special characters - without writing 27 different If statements!

The finished product I find is the best solutions at the current time. It is nowhere near perfect, and could always use future improvement!

- Probably wouldn't have figured out how to concatenate a string like I did in this project, without this page on [Turing.com](https://www.turing.com/kb/guide-to-string-concatenation-in-js)
